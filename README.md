Medical Cost Personal Dataset - Linear Regression Project
This project focuses on applying linear regression to the "Medical Cost Personal Dataset" to predict individual medical insurance charges based on demographic and lifestyle factors. It serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and linear regression model building and evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Medical Cost Personal Dataset", which contains information about individuals, including:

Age: Age of the primary beneficiary
Sex: Insurance contractor gender, female or male
BMI: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body weight, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, an objective index of body weight (kg / m^2) using the ratio of weight to the square of height, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
children: Number of children covered by health insurance/number of dependents
smoker: Smoker or non-smoker
region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

Project Structure
The project is organised as follows:
Medical_Cost_Linear_Regression.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data cleaning, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
Insurance.csv: The dataset file.
